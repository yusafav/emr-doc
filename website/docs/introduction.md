<!-- ## Overview

By implementing EMR, patient data can be tracked over an extended period of time by multiple healthcare providers. It can help identify those who are due for preventive checkups and screenings and monitor how each patient measures up to certain requirements like vaccinations and blood pressure readings. EMRs are designed to help organizations provide efficient and precise care. -->
